# A-Deep-Learning-Approach-Integrating-Soil-and-Environmental-Factors-with-Feature-Scaling-Technique
Using Feedforward Neural Networks (FNN), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), RNN with Bahdanau model (attention layer) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) with feature scaling techniques. 
FNN (97.88) along with GRU (97.5) models performed with high accuracy.

The models performed better than the existing models in terms of performance and
model evaluation that has added an additional layer for simple Recurrent Neural Network model and feature scaling methods helps the Gated Recurrent Unit model to perform better. FeedForward Neural Network and GRU (Standard Scaler) models are performed with good results.
